A) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
     There will be a hidden file named .git in your directory once you initialize a respository. It records the history of metadata. we can see it only if we type ls -a in GitBash.
     Initializing a repository can help us track all the files which we have commited.

B)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
     Keep commits small with one commit per loggical change.
     staging area is intermediate area
     Git bundles the entire contents of the staging area into a single commit and adds that to a respository

D)How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
     1)git add fileName
     2)git diff --statged   comparing the commit 1 and staging field
     3)git commit           if the 2) shows the logical change what you want, then do 3)

E)What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
     Italian version/ experimental feature

Fï¼‰How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
     git log --graph --oneline branchNameA branchNameB using the different symbole help distinguish different banches
