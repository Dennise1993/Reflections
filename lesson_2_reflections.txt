A) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
     There will be a hidden file named .git in your directory once you initialize a respository. It records the history of metadata. we can see it only if we type ls -a in GitBash.
     Initializing a repository can help us track all the files which we have commited.

B)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
     Keep commits small with one commit per loggical change.
     staging area is intermediate area
     Git bundles the entire contents of the staging area into a single commit and adds that to a respository
